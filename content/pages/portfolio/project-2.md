Movie Database is an IMDB-inspired web application created using a node.js server that allows users to browse, and contribute information on various movies, actors and other users. 

*   This application was developed in the context of Carleton's computer science course: Fundamentals of Web Applications.

*   Built using Express for the backend and MongoDB as a NoSQL database program.

*   Utilized Pug to make it easier to write re-usable dynamic code for HTML, and easily render information pulled from the database.
